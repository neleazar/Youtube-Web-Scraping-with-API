can I ask you what type of degrre did you have to work in a nba team?
So cool!!üòä
I think it&#39;s a male dominated field because, generally speaking, men are more interested in math and data science than women are and not because there&#39;s a gate keeper keeping women out of the profession.
Great and inspirational video!
Wish the data was open source üòä
Interesting, never thought you&#39;d analyze sports data like this
What.... This so new for me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpLHMKTolVw&amp;t=5m43s">5:43</a> it is not &quot;sort of&quot; the ideal mix, it is a perfect mix
Great video
what does gender have to do with it. Cant it be about math
data scientist/music producer here i come!!!!
Very inspiring. Great video!
she should of predicted that Ben Simmons has to be sold earlier.
2 minute time: Team A takes 12 three pointers only and makes 3 shots for 9 points 25%. Team B takes 12 two points and makes 6 plus 2 fouls and they make 3 out of 4 foul shots. Team B has 15 points.  Even if you give Team A another three they have 12 points. Team B still wins and Team A shot 33% from three which is close to avg. The point is it matters who is tanking the threes and who is taking the FGs, not just a matter of stats, it‚Äôs both
Of course, CNBC woke agenda will make it appear as if this was a one person effort. Because highlighting her colleagues contribution will only diminish your narrative.
What&#39;s her instagram?
entar aja lah, mau ambil data science setelah benar2 dapat PhD aja, fokus ke web developer buat dapat kerjaan sekarang
This is so cool
So is this how NBA 2K visual concepts are able to determine‚Ä¶ player attributes, Tendencies, athleticism, Defense, offense and so on???
Is it that bad? I guess women are playing the victim card.
The person with the best game plans is the person who can detect patterns
Ivana is Awesome!
sixers: how do we win?<br>data scientist: lose 300 games in a row
The sound in this video is abnoxius. The hiss and every little noise in there is picked up by the mic. I can&#39;t stand it.
Take this European fiba the world championship bullshit out of here! This is not Basketball
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Why dont players just man up and fight through screens?<br><br>-shaq 2021<br><br>ü§°
Look at Ivana man, so inspirational :,)
Even a female mathematician doesn&#39;t want to work for WNBA.
Amazing content. Data is simply awesome.
Wow how math is in everything
You are a true inspiration..
Fantastic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpLHMKTolVw&amp;t=3m10s">3:10</a> says pick n roll but shows a pick n pop... tells you all you need to know about analytics.
interesting
Hopefully they weren&#39;t behind that Al Harford signing.
Literally am going to be a data scientist because of this. I hope I can work for an mls team with data analytics with my soccer background. Amazing and inspiring video.
Ahhhhh Daryl morey it&#39;s gonna be happy with this analytics team
I‚Äôd hardly say the 76ers have an advantage over anybody lol
After current season, 6ers need to reassess the standards of competency of these data scientists lol
She‚Äôs a badass
lmao 76ers are fucking tryhards
NBA data scientist would have Shaq sitting on the 3 pt line.  These teams launching 3&#39;s left and right aren&#39;t winning championships.  Even the Warriors in their run weren&#39;t chucking 3&#39;s left and right.
It&#39;s a bunch bs
This video was awesome!
She is awesome
She is a data scientist, and she can&#39;t tell that the reason there are less women hired as data scientists, is because less women pursue that carreer relative to men, and not because of a bias in the hiring process. She had equal chances when she sent her postulation than the men ceteris paribus.
of course she&#39;s foreign. what was i thinking
Kawhi ‚úãanalyticaly imposible to stop :-)
Thank you bloomberg. This was very knowledgable and it inspires me
Cool, you love what you are doing!<br>I&#39;m also becoming a ML Engineer!
Since I&#39;m also from Croatia, currently a Computer science student and started playing basketball since I was 7, this inspired me immensely. I even wrote Ivana an email to which she unfortunately didn&#39;t respond, so I was thinking maybe you guys have some tips and guidance how to specialize in this concrete field (which literature, courses, basketball-related tips, anything).<br>Thanks in advance!
how can I get a career like this? I specfically want to work in sports and performance. will a masters degree in computer science/ data science help?
Math in sport gives you an edge. Who knew!!
I can fully understand but it is really amazing how data science have enlarged the importance of such small areas which were neglected in the past.
USA will lost many of bright talents if they keep on limiting FOREIGNERS entering their country... She is a rare combo indeed
Lays with dog. Avoid at all cost
Half the phd grads are &#39;Data Scientists&#39;, just a glorified analyst.
I wonder how that job is interesting for her that she is PhD.
Narrativea
Why does she needs a PHD to do this kind of work? One does not need a PHD to do that. Most of the work is already done for her by the software. I do the same type of work and I do not have a PHD, overrated.
Nobody cares if you are a man or a woman if you&#39;re doing your job well
IVANA AND SIXERS SUCKS !!!
Not only she is smart but she is actually beautiful as well
I think this job will replace for AI...<br>I really wants be this job. But Fucking AI
I have google.
Those who can play coach; those who can&#39;t coach go in to journalism; those who are too pretentious for that get into analytics. Thus spoke Zarathustra...
This is the type of stat person a team needs. She is someone who is a numbers genius but knows enough about basketball to understand that the numbers change in certain situations. For example 3 pointers are better then 2 pointers but its easier for defenders to guard the 3 point line then it is the guard mid range shooters. The thing is since she is a basketball player she understands this while others will say, &quot;all you have to do is shoot 3s and lay ups&quot;
I think being a woman or female is already a disadvantage for them to compete to us men or males. Whether it is in sports or academics or even in tech and engineering. One big reason is that they are the one responsible for child bearing and mostly child rearing. I&#39;m not saying it is not doable but it is an unfair disadvantage if they&#39;re competing with men.

I think this video is sort of pushing gender inequality. Which is all in a persons head. Look at this woman. She thought she couldn&#39;t get the job. But she got it. I don&#39;t see any reason why a woman could not do this job or any less capable than a man. I&#39;m a male, diesel mechanic. I wish I was a scientist, if I wanted to, I could be one. I&#39;m too lazy to go back to college and study for it I guess. I also suck at math. But if anyone wants to do something bad enough and the possibilites are reasonable, then it&#39;s just a matter of time. The fact that she thought she couldn&#39;t get the job was all inside of her head. Also you have to look at percentage of applicants for this job. The video stated only 26% data scientist were female, but you need to look at how many applicants were female vs male. I don&#39;t know for sure, but I&#39;m guessing that the majority of applicants were male, therefore more males hold that position because there were simply more males to have applied than females.

Data Scientist = Statistician
simply showing percentage of women data scientist does not justify that the field prefers man...
The will to win.. I want to know the statistics or any specific number on each player about this.
Jezez the gender aspect really wasn&#39;t necessary here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpLHMKTolVw&amp;t=00m31s">00:31</a> she should teach Ben Simmons how to shoot...
All the analytics in the world won‚Äôt help Ben Simmons get a jump shot üòÇüòÇ
It is  so motivated.
What kind of bike is she riding
She got a better jumper than Ben Simmons for real
I would love a job like this. I&#39;m working on my Master&#39;s in Business Analytics. Hopefully, I can land a job in something similar
Having a PhD in math... 26% of Data Scientist in NBA are women... just wondering the amount of women having a PhD in maths...
thank steph curry for the way the game is played today
A made up job. Their are super fans who are more knowledgeable and can predict who has a better jump, a better pick and roll and etc.
All this data stuff is bullshit. Keep relying on data, and enjoy losing before the conference finals
this was a great cover.  data science for the win!!
There is a magnet in the ball and in the rim. NBA decide whether shot goes in or not...
‚Äú turning it into‚Äù getcho goof ass <br>Wtf u think people are doin out there everyday
Raptor have better data scientist üòÇ
10 (wo)man analytics team. Very impressive.
Every time she Said Eevanha my ears hurt
This bs right here
Sounds like overengineered bullcrap, unless you believe the past is always an indication of the future which is not how the world tends to work.
this data works better for MLB or NFL cause in the NHL/NBA the coaches usually go with gut feeling and a name like Reddick or Leonard. Though I will say that thanks to this data now every team has deadly 3 point average compared to 20 yrs ago where you had 1 or 2 players who could shoot from behind the 3 pt line.
Data science + business degree is lit
so she is behind all those ridiculous stats?
Daryl Morey and the analytics folks have been doing this for the last 20 damn years. Sabermetrics, shot value, efficiency ... and it hasn&#39;t won them a single damn Championship. Numbers only take you so far: in the end, it&#39;s all down to talent, grit and effort when everyone&#39;s arms are too damn tired to shoot the same 45 percent arc they do in the regular season. Not to say that it isn&#39;t useful, of course, but the team with the better chemistry and the better coaching adjustments beats a bunch of numbers  adjudging tendency and conversion rates any day, every day.
I guess you‚Äôre math didn‚Äôt add up
Croatia power
